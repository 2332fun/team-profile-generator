# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

What: My motivation for this project was to make a simplistic and user-friendly scheduler. My efforts have made a page where the user can click the description space to edit the schedule's text, then save via clicking the button with the intuitive save icon. The background color of the row will indicate if it is a past, present, or future time from their current moment of looking at the page.
